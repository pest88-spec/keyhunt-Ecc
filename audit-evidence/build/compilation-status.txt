=== COMPILATION STATUS REPORT ===

Date: $(date +"%Y-%m-%d")

BUILD STATUS: FAILED

Required Dependencies:
- CMake (NOT FOUND)
- CUDA Toolkit (nvcc NOT FOUND)
- GCC/G++ (FOUND)

Build Attempt Summary:
The build failed due to missing CMake, which is required to compile the KEYHUNT-ECC CUDA library.

Error Messages:
- Line 4: /bin/sh: 1: cmake: not found
- Line 5: make[1]: *** [Makefile:29: ../KEYHUNT-ECC/build/libkeyhunt_ecc.a] Error 127

Root Cause:
CMake is not installed in the build environment. The KEYHUNT-ECC library requires CMake >= 3.18 
to configure and build the CUDA components.

Resolution Path:
1. Install CMake >= 3.18
2. Install CUDA Toolkit >= 11.0
3. Re-run make command

Build System Analysis:
- Root Makefile delegates to albertobsd-keyhunt/Makefile
- KEYHUNT-ECC library build is triggered as a dependency
- CMake is used to configure CUDA compilation for the ECC library
- GCC/G++ compiler chain is available for C/C++ components
